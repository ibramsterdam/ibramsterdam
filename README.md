## Yo! Bram here! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‘‹

I like to talk about Fitness, Games and Coding. I have a BEd in **Physical Education** and a BSc in **Software Engineering** and after 8 years of study I can say for sure I am not persuing a degree in gaming. Helping others makes me happy and when I heard Ruby is the programming language developed for **Programmer Happiness** I had to take a look. And I have never looked back. 

Currently working professionaly in Ruby on Rails since 2022.


I really enjoy working with **Neovim** and **Ruby on Rails**.
