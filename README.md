## Yo! Bram here! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy discussing **Fitness**, **Games**, and **Coding**.<br>
Helping others brings me joy, and when I found out that Ruby is designed for **Programmer Happiness** , I had to take a look. 

I've never looked back.

Thank you  [Sebastian](https://github.com/stomescu), [TK](https://github.com/krtschmr), [Marek](https://github.com/mdh), [Petrik](https://github.com/p8) & [Andrius](https://github.com/andriusch) !

  <summary>How you influenced me</summary>

Thank you [Sebastian](https://github.com/stomescu) for having me as your intern. For putting faith in me and spending hours teaching me the programming fundamentals. You showed me the ropes of React and Typescript and let me fall in love with being a web developer. I could not having imagined a better first senior.

I will never forget encountering my first Ruby on Rails ninja, [TK](https://github.com/krtschmr). With the strongest Git skills known to developer-kind, a truly amazing entrpeneurial spirit and the biggest passion for the Rails framework. Thank you for introducing me to Rails and spending countless hours on calls with me, explaining how I could become a ninja myself.

You have treated me with respect and valued my opinion on important decisions as if I were your equal, [Marek](https://github.com/mdh). Thank you for entrusting me with the codebase of your amazing platform, Bordfolio, where I was able to complete my thesis on web accessibility for online platforms and graduate for my BSc Software Engineering. Not to forget his brother [Petrik](https://github.com/p8), who showed me how amazing the open-source culture of Ruby on Rails is. The feeling I had when contributing to Rails made me realize that I want to be part of this community.
Because of you two I have felt the courage to make neovim my main editor and it has treated me so well!

I have the deepest respect for [Andrius](https://github.com/andriusch). Your integrity in coding and code reviews is truly inspiring. Thank you for your patience and for teaching me best practices in writing quality software. You helped me mature as a developer and shed my junior mindset.
