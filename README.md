## Yo! Bram here! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy discussing **Fitness**, **Games**, and **Coding**. I hold a Bachelor of Education in **Physical Education** and a Bachelor of Science in **Software Engineering**. Helping others brings me joy, and when I found out that Ruby is designed for **Programmer Happiness** , I had to take a look. 

I've never looked back. 

Since 2022, I've been professionally working with **Ruby on Rails**
